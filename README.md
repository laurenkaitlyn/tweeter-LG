## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

Test out the tweet function by entering your tweet in the text box and clicking the 'tweet' button. You cannot tweet if nothing has been input into the textbox OR if it is above the 140 character count.

The new tweet will appear at the top.
